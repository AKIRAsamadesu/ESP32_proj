CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory C:/Users/50127/Desktop/cubic_project/My_cubic/2-software/my_cubic_proj/build/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory /home/zhou/Desktop/TVmini/My_cubic/2-software/my_cubic_proj/build where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
CMake Error: The source "C:/Users/50127/Desktop/cubic_project/My_cubic/2-software/my_cubic_proj/CMakeLists.txt" does not match the source "/home/zhou/Desktop/TVmini/My_cubic/2-software/my_cubic_proj/CMakeLists.txt" used to generate cache.  Re-run cmake with a different source directory.
